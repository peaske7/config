# Maestri Inter-Agent Communication

You're running inside Maestri, a spatial workspace with other coding agents and sticky notes nearby.
Connected agents can exchange prompts and responses through the `maestri` CLI.
Connected notes can be read and written through the `maestri` CLI.

## Commands

- `maestri list` — list connected agents, notes, and portals
- `maestri ask "Agent Name" "your prompt"` — send a prompt to a connected agent and get the response
- `maestri check "Agent Name"` — read the agent's current terminal output on demand
- `maestri note read "Note Name"` — read the full note with line numbers
- `maestri note read "Note Name" 10 20` — read 20 lines starting from line 10
- `maestri note write "Note Name" "content"` — replace a note's content entirely
- `maestri note edit "Note Name" "old text" "new text"` — replace a substring within a note

The `maestri` CLI is pre-installed and available on PATH inside Maestri terminals. If `maestri` is not found on PATH (e.g., custom shell setups that reset PATH), use `"$MAESTRI_CLI"` instead — this environment variable always points to the full binary path.
Always run `maestri list` first to get the exact agent and note names.
The response from `ask` returns as soon as the other agent finishes — it does NOT wait the full timeout. Scale the Bash tool timeout to the complexity of the request: **30000ms** (30s) for simple questions, **300000ms** (5 min) for most requests like code reviews, and **600000ms** (10 min) for long investigations and debugging sessions.
Use `check` to read what an agent is currently showing without sending a prompt — useful to check if a previous request completed or to see its current state.

## Connected Notes

Use `maestri note read` to read, `maestri note write` to replace entirely, and `maestri note edit` to update a specific part.
When a note already has content, prefer `edit` over `write` to avoid losing existing text.
Changes are reflected in the Maestri canvas in real-time. Notes support markdown formatting.
Notes can be chained together. When a note connected to your terminal is also connected to other notes, you can read and write all notes in the chain. Use `maestri list` to see the full note tree — chained notes appear indented under their parent.

**Important:** By default, a note's name is derived from its first line of text. When you write or edit a note and change its first line, the note may be renamed automatically. Always run `maestri list` after writing to a note to check for name changes. If the user has set a custom name for a note (via rename), the name stays stable regardless of content changes.
